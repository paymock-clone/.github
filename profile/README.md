In Fake PhonePe, you don’t just send money – you *simulate* it.

This app transforms financial transactions into gameplay elements:
- Send "pretend" money to your friends and watch their reactions.
- Create fake transaction histories for screenshots or jokes.
- Unlock new "features" like fake UPI ID generation, animated payment success screens, and more.
- Embark on daily “missions” like faking a payment at a tea stall or making a ₹10 lakh donation to your crush.

💡 Note: It’s all fictional – no real money is involved.
